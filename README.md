# TANKGAME
Welcome to Tank Game! Here are the rules.
Use WASD to move, arrows to shoot.
The space key enables side shooting mode, where your bullet flies to the side a little bit.
The Q key generates "bullet nasa" (crazy bullet), whose track you would never know.
The E key erects walls to protect you.
